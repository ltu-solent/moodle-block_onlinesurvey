moodle-block_onlinesurvey
=====================================
The moodle plugin allows you to view open surveys within a block in Moodle.

Detail: 
By using the "onlinesurvey" plug-in, open surveys for a user are displayed within a block in Moodle. The data request for open surveys of a user can be carried out via SOAP or LTI. 
The connection to a user can be established either on the basis of the user name or the email address. 
If the user name is used, a specified EvaSys custom field can serve as a method of authentication. 
In the case of LTI, it is possible to define customized LTI parameters and to map the LTI specific roles "Instructor" and "Learner" in Moodle, e.g. "Learner" --> "Student".
It is also possible to use a pop-up message to alert participants about open surveys.
